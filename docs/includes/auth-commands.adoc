// Authentication commands - included twice

The following declarations control MAC authentication:

[[controlkey]]+controlkey+ _key_::
  Specifies the key identifier to use with the
  {ntpqman} utility, which uses the standard protocol defined in
  RFC 5905. The _key_ argument is the key identifier for a trusted key,
  where the value can be in the range 1 to 65,535, inclusive.

[[keys]]+keys+ _keyfile_::
  Specifies the complete path and location of the key file
  containing the keys and key identifiers used by {ntpdman},
  and {ntpqman} when operating with symmetric-key cryptography.
  This is the same operation as the +-k+ command line option.

[[trustedkey]]+trustedkey+ _key..._ ::
  Specifies the key identifiers which are trusted for the purposes of
  authenticating servers with symmetric key cryptography, as well as keys
  used by the {ntpqman} program.
  Multiple keys on the same line should be separated by spaces.
  Key ranges can be specified as (first ... last).  The spaces around
  the ... are necessary.  Multiple +trustedkey+ lines are supported
  and trusted keys can also be specified on the command line.

The MAC authentication procedures require that both the local and remote
servers share the same key id, key type, and key text.
The easiest way to do this is to copy the whole line.
Different keys should be used for each server-client pair.
The _key_id_ arguments are integers with values from 1 to 65,535.
